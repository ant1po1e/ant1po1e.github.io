# Rethinking Terminology

Some common mapping terms—like layering or impact—are avoided because they can be vague or misleading. Instead:

- Layering is reframed as structure, usually shaped by musical repetition.
- Impact is understood as the natural effect of how humans perceive sound and translate it into another sensory form.

In short, the aim is to ground mapping concepts in clearer, more precise definitions rather than relying on conventional but ambiguous terms
