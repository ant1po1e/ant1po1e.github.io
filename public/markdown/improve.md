# How to Improve

Improving as a mapper is simple in theory: gain more experience. The real challenge lies in being intentional about growth. This requires deliberate practice and active engagement:

- Explore widely: Regularly check pending or in-progress maps. Study them critically to spot both strengths and weaknesses.
- Study your own tastes: Play and revisit maps you enjoy. Ask yourself what specifically makes them appealing.
- Limit editor time: Spend no more than ten hours per map. This forces you to focus on what truly matters instead of over-polishing.
- Replicate to learn: Try creating maps inspired by the ones you admire. This isn’t copying—it’s a way to internalize what you like and make it part of your own style.
- Refine your taste: Over time, these habits naturally shape and expand your preferences, helping you develop a unique identity as a mapper.
