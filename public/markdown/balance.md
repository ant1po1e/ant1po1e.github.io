# Balance as Meta-Term

Balance is the most important concept, serving as a “meta-term” that connects all other aspects of mapping. Rather than a strict technical rule, balance is about how different elements work together. It relates closely to:

- Consistency: Creating a coherent experience across the map so players feel grounded.
- Repetition: Respecting recurring sounds in a straightforward way, reinforcing familiarity.
- Variation: Introducing differences to keep things fresh, especially during repetitive parts of a song.

These aren’t rigid rules—they shift depending on context. For instance, heavy variation may be needed to keep a repetitive section engaging, while consistency can still be preserved in smaller details. Likewise, breaking consistency intentionally can highlight a particularly important sound or moment. In every case, the ultimate goal is balance.
